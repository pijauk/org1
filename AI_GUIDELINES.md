# AI Guidelines & Instructions

## Design System
- **ALWAYS** prioritize using the existing project UI components located in `components/ui/` (shadcn/ui).
- Do not create custom CSS or ad-hoc components if a shadcn component can serve the purpose.
- Check `components/ui/` before implementing new UI features.

## Backend & Data
- **Supabase** is connected to this project. Assume Supabase for auth, database, and backend logic.
